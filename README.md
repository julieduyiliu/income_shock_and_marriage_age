## Abstract
This paper studies how negative income shocks affect the age of marriage of females, particularly early marriage in China. In many places in China, there are monetary transfers that occur with marriage: bride price and dowry. Income shocks may affect the age of marriage because marriage payments are a source of consumption smoothing, particularly for a woman's family. In this paper, I use droughts as a proxy for income shock. I found that with 1 unit of decrease in precipitation in the previous year or the current year, the girl's marriage age will be 0.3% earlier. In places that have higher bride prices, this number is 0.4%. The results indicate that the age of marriage responds to changes in aggregate economic conditions if the bride price exists. This suggests that regulating the high level of bride price and providing prompt and effective subsidies to families affected by income shock may be the solution to the phenomenon of early marriage.
